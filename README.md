## Technologies Used

_Webpage is built with HTML, CSS (specifically using a default bootstrap.css file/framework with minimal styling), javaScript, and the jQuery3.2.0 files/framework. Color choice menu has a custom option, which upon selection shows a hidden visual color picker to allow specific hexcode colors to be selected and applied to the motorcycle. Color picker disappears upon selection of any default color choice. Grady L Shelton and Epicodus are not liable for anything beyond Rowdy Market's webpage. Rowdy's market is not real and is just a practice exercise._
